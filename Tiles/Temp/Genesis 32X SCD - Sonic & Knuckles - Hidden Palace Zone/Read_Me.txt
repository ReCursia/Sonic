HIDDEN PALACE ZONE

PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE SONIC RIPPING PROJECT
RIPPED BY THE OBSERVER | CREDIT NOT NECESSARY

FOREGROUND:
Split into two versions of the stage map due to palette affectations via in-game triggers or resets via the Bonus Stage (the 0408 and 0517 Sonic 3 prototypes).
Labelled as G for the trigger version, and P for the reset version.
Red blocks in the maps are animated objects, demonstrated on the objects sheet. Remove remaining red color when inserting the spiral objects.

BACKGROUND:
Everything between the Death Egg crater block for the top and the rocky pillars for the bottom operate on a horizontal-only 2.5D system.

OBJECTS:
Due to a low amount, animated and static objects are located on a singular sheet and will be obvious as to which objects are in which category.
As noted above, the following are denoted by red blocks: Emerald Shrine Orbs, Teleporter Spirals and Lanterns.

TILES:
Broken down into 128x128 tiles for people to arrange as they like.

NOTES ABOUT BACKGROUND:
The second to last 2.5D strip of the seven small background pieces is split into two main objects. This is because the left object is the 'start', and the right object is the normal pattern.
The small black blocks aligned to each strip of the 2.5D part of the background are seen with foreground layers disabled and moving around with Debug. They can go on either the left or the right of the objects, but aren't normal.
The lower background is split into two pieces. The left is seen (with foreground layer disabled for some of it) upon entering the Hidden Palace. The rest is what loops, and appears as background to the Emerald Shrine.
